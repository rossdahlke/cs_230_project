# This file does all of the data processing for the training data
# I start with "raw" data in the format that I recieved from the Center for Deliberative Democracy
# This "raw" data is stored in "data/raw"
# And the processed data is stored in "data/processed"

# The main task for this script:
# 1. Rename transcripts so that they are easy read in during model building

# important: for now, this script will only rename files to fit the naming convention below
# since there are a variety of NLP tasks that I will be using these transcripts for,
# different preprocessing is needed for different tasks
# depending on how long preprocessing takes, I will either just include it in the analysis script
# or I will append preprocessing onto this script

# There are multiple different Deliberative Polls, each with about 15 groups which conduct 2-3 different sessions
# To standardize the data, I will labels transcripts and survey results as:
# dp[a]_group[b]_session[1]
# For example, Deliberative Poll #1, Group #2, Session #3 will be labeled as:
# dp1_group2_session3

# start by importing packages
import numpy as np
import os
from os import listdir
from os.path import isfile, join

# let's get a list of files we want to read in
